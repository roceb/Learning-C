| Common Questions | ConEdison | NM | NYWNC |
|-----------|---------| --- | --- |
| Challenges  | Working | Working in a newly created team | Leading a team of devs, qa and designers |
| Mistakes/Failures | trying to move too fast in a slow environment | Working with overseas | Allocating devs to QA |
| Enjoyed | The structure left little to second guessing myself | The fact that I joined a small new team, I got to teach my peers as well as spend a lot of time going through documentation | The freedom of picking my team and what technology to solve business problems |
| Leadership | Lead presentation on the benefits of SRE principles. Used team as an example model of what a reliabitiy team can accomplish | As the senior in the team, I took it upon myself to establish best practices | Worked with 3 different teams, including dev, qa, designers |
| Conflicts | Struggled with the slow movement of adaptation. As well as getting some of my projects green lit took a long time | NM is a big companyy that is unfortuantly disorganized. They use so many technologies, but as a new team, their documentation is subpar. I struggle locating coworkers that might be able to glide me in the right direction | We did not have an appropiate understanding or a dedicated devops team. Many of our issues would have been fixed if we had implimated more agile and devops principles |
| What youâ€™d do differently | I would have like to take a more leadership position, where I can help the company adapt and move towards a path where technology could help increase the bottomline | If I could do anything differently, I would have applied to a more archtect centric role. While I learned a lot from their documentation, there was plenty of top down changes I would make as to how documentation and knowledge transfers are done | If i could do anything differently I would take some of my devs and teach them devops. As well as understanding more the designer workflow and how to impliment it in a agile environment |
